# Raw Data

This folder holds potential energy surface data for a variety of systems. 
The data is either generated with:
    * Displacements with MLChem followed by the submission of jobs to quantum chemistry packages
    * Displacements generated with MLChem, and then evaluated with analytic PES from the literature with  [PyPES-lib](https://github.com/dlc62/pypes-lib) 
    * Data obtained directly from publications supplementary material
