# PES of Formaldehyde I
This potential energy surface for formaldehyde is published [here](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.3599927).  
Level of theory is CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVQZ    
The 500 data points come from the 500 supplied in the SI.   
These are energies produced by the PES, NOT an ab initio computation, so they are not exact.  

Energies are in units of wavenumbers (cm<sup>-1</sup>), and relative to the global minimum of the surface.
