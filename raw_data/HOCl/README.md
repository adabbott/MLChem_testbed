# PES of HOCl 
This potential energy surface for HOCl is published [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386142597000140).  
Only 65 points in the vicinity of the minimum were computed.
Raw data not published so we generate with PyPES.
Level of theory is CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVQZ 
Energies are in units of wavenumbers (cm<sup>-1</sup>), and relative to the global minimum of the surface.
